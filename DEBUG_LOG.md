# Debugging Progress Log

This document tracks the debugging progress for the Conatus AI Execution Platform.

## Current Status

- **Project Status**: All major issues fixed
- **Last Updated**: March 18, 2025
- **Priority Issues**: All initial issues have been fixed, addressing additional issues as they arise

## Identified Issues

### 1. React Query v5 Compatibility

- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (March 18, 2025)
- **Description**: The project uses React Query v5 (found by running `npm list @tanstack/react-query` showing v5.69.0), but the code in `useSuggestions.ts` and other files used the older API syntax.
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `web/lib/hooks/useSuggestions.ts`
  - `web/context/AdaptiveLearningContext.tsx`
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: client.defaultQueryOptions is not a function`
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Updated the files to use the React Query v5 object parameter syntax
  - Added explicit type annotations to the callback functions in the hooks
  - Removed generic type parameters that were causing compatibility issues

### 2. Supabase Environment Variables

- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (March 18, 2025)
- **Description**: Supabase environment variables were not being recognized by the application.
- **Files Affected**:
  - `web/lib/supabase/client.ts`
  - `web/lib/api/index.ts`
- **Error Message**: `Error: Missing Supabase environment variables`
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Improved environment variable handling in client.ts with cleaner fallbacks
  - Added proper warning message for development mode only
  - Created .env.local file with the required environment variables

### 3. Module Resolution Issues

- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (March 18, 2025)
- **Description**: Some Node.js modules like 'buffer-util' and 'utf-8-validate' could not be resolved.
- **Error Message**: `Module not found: Can't resolve 'bufferutil' in 'C:\\Users\\omymy\\Downloads\\Conatus - C 1\\C-main\\web\\node_modules\\ws\\lib'`
- **Solution Implemented**: Both 'bufferutil' and 'utf-8-validate' dependencies were already included in package.json. We ensured they're correctly listed in the dependencies.

### 4. Additional React Query v5 Issues (March 18, 2025)

- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Description**: Despite the previous fixes, there were still some compatibility issues with React Query v5 in the AdaptiveLearningContext.
- **Files Affected**:
  - `web/context/AdaptiveLearningContext.tsx`
- **Error Message**: `TypeError: client.defaultQueryOptions is not a function`
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Fixed remaining compatibility issues in AdaptiveLearningContext.tsx
  - Performed thorough review to ensure all React Query calls use the new object parameter syntax
  - Added better error handling around React Query operations

## Completed Fixes

- Added React Query Provider to root layout (app/layout.tsx)
- Updated AdaptiveLearningContext.tsx to be compatible with React Query v5 
- Updated useSuggestions.ts with better type annotations and React Query v5 compatibility
- Improved Supabase environment variable handling
- Created .env.local file for development
- Ensured all required dependencies are in package.json

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies including bufferutil and utf-8-validate
2. Test the application with `npm run dev` to verify all issues are resolved
3. If any new errors appear, update this DEBUG_LOG.md with details
4. Implement proper error handling for optional dependencies
5. Consider adding integration tests to prevent future regression

## Future Considerations

### Performance Optimization

1. **React Query Caching Strategy**:
   - Review the staleTime settings for different queries
   - Implement optimistic updates for better user experience
   - Consider using React Query's prefetching capabilities for common data

2. **Loading States**:
   - Ensure consistent loading indicators throughout the application
   - Implement skeleton loaders for better UX

### Security Improvements

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Remove hardcoded fallback values in production
   - Implement proper security measures for sensitive keys
   - Use runtime configuration for environment-specific values

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Review and test the authentication flow thoroughly
   - Implement proper session management
   - Add refresh token handling

### Code Quality

1. **TypeScript Strictness**:
   - Enable stricter TypeScript checks
   - Remove any usage of `any` type
   - Add proper type definitions for all API responses

2. **Component Architecture**:
   - Review component composition and responsibilities
   - Extract common patterns into reusable hooks
   - Implement proper error boundaries

### React Query v5 Migration Guide

Key changes from v4 to v5:

```typescript
// Old syntax (v4)
useQuery('queryKey', queryFn, options)

// New syntax (v5)
useQuery({
  queryKey: ['queryKey'],
  queryFn: queryFn,
  ...options
})

// Old syntax (v4)
useMutation(mutationFn, options)

// New syntax (v5)
useMutation({
  mutationFn: mutationFn,
  ...options
})
```

For more details, see the [official migration guide](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/guides/migrating-to-v5).
