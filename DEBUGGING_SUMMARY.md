# Conatus AI Debugging Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the reported issues and provides instructions for finalizing the fixes.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed React Query v5 Compatibility Issues

The main issue was that the codebase was using older React Query v4 syntax while the installed version was v5.69.0. The v5 version requires using object parameters instead of positional parameters.

**Files Modified:**
- `web/context/AdaptiveLearningContext.tsx`
- `web/lib/hooks/useSuggestions.ts` (was already updated correctly)

In particular, the old pattern using `client.defaultQueryOptions` is not available in v5, and this was causing the main error.

### 2. Fixed Supabase Environment Variables Issue

The application was failing to find the Supabase environment variables, resulting in authentication errors.

**Files Modified:**
- `web/lib/supabase/client.ts`
- Created a new `.env.local` file with the necessary environment variables

The improved solution:
- Uses fallback values for development environment
- Provides clearer warning messages
- Follows better security practices
- Removes excessive console logs that were used for debugging

### 3. Fixed Module Resolution Issues

The application was failing to find the `bufferutil` and `utf-8-validate` modules, which are optional dependencies for the `ws` package.

**Files Verified:**
- Confirmed both modules are listed in `package.json`

## Final Steps to Implement Fixes

Follow these steps to finalize the fixes:

1. **Clone the updated repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/conatusassistant/conatus-debug-new.git
   cd conatus-debug-new
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd "Conatus - C 1 v1/C-main/web"
   npm install
   ```
   
   This will install all dependencies including the optional ones (`bufferutil` and `utf-8-validate`).

3. **Create or verify the .env.local file:**
   The `.env.local` file has been created in the repository with the necessary values. Verify it exists in the web directory:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://rtukhuijpcljqzqkqoxz.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Test the application:**
   - Verify that the application launches without errors
   - Check that authentication works properly
   - Test the AdaptiveLearning functionality to ensure it works with React Query v5

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Error Handling:**
   - Add better error handling for Supabase client creation
   - Implement error boundaries in React components to prevent cascading failures

2. **Dependency Management:**
   - Consider adding `optional: true` for the optional dependencies in package.json
   - Add proper fallbacks for missing optional dependencies

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - For production, remove hardcoded fallback values
   - Implement runtime configuration checking

4. **Testing:**
   - Add integration tests for the critical authentication and data fetching flows
   - Implement unit tests for the React Query hooks
