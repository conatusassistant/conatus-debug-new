## Established Code Patterns and Standards

### Component Architecture Pattern
All components follow consistent patterns for imports, types, state, and rendering.

```tsx
'use client';

// 1. Imports (grouped by source)
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
// External libraries
// Internal components
// Utilities and hooks

// 2. Type definitions
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props definition
}

// 3. Component declaration
export default function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  // 4. Hooks initialization
  const [state, setState] = useState<string>('');
  
  // 5. Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // 6. Event handlers and helper functions
  const handleAction = () => {
    // Logic
  };
  
  // 7. Conditional rendering
  if (condition) {
    return <AlternateView />;
  }
  
  // 8. Main render
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Styling with TailwindCSS
All components use TailwindCSS following this ordering:
1. Layout (display, position)
2. Size (width, height)
3. Spacing (margin, padding)
4. Typography (font, text)
5. Colors and backgrounds
6. Borders and effects
7. Responsive modifiers

## Running the Application

### Local Setup

1. Clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/conatusassistant/C.git
   cd C
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment:
   ```bash
   cp web/.env.example web/.env.local
   ```

3. Set required environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:web
   npm run dev:backend  # In a separate terminal
   ```

### Testing

1. Run integration tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration
   ```

2. Generate performance report:
   ```bash
   npm run report:performance
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è
